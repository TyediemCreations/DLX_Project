The columns represent the constraints of the puzzle:
	-Position constraint: Only 1 number can occupy a cell
	-Row constraint: Only 1 instance of a number can be in a column
	-Column constraint: Only 1 instance of a number can be in a column
	-A region constraint: Only 1 instance of a number can be in a region

Each number comes with its own set of constraints.
=> SIZE^2 * 4
	s.t. SIZE = 9
=> 324 columns

The rows represent every single possible position for every number.
=> SIZE^3
	s.t. SIZE = 9
=> 729 rows

(Each row would represent only one candidate position. Therefore, only 4 1's will be in the row, representing the constraints of that position.)


*Given the initial positions in the matrix, those rows will be included in the answer and 'covered'. Then the Search algorithm will produce the solutions to the puzzle.
